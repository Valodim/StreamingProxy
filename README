placeholder readme, improve later

This is a specialized proxy for streamed content.

Motivation: I disliked mplayer's buffering behavior, and wanted a local
player-independent cache, so I took this opportunity to learn the excellent
Twisted framework.

Status: At this point, the software is mostly working. It does however have
some drawbacks annoying enough to make it mostly unusable for daily business.
Still a wip, hope I can get this out of alpha soon.
